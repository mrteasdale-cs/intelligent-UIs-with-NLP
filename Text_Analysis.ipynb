    "# Part 3 NER\n",
    "Named Entity Recognition, or NER, is a fundamental technique in natural language processing. It automatically finds and classifies important items in text, such as names of people, organizations, places, dates, and monetary values. NER works by first identifying the boundaries of these entities and then assigning them to categories like PERSON, ORGANIZATION, or LOCATION.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process turns unstructured text into structured data, which is useful for tasks like extracting information, answering questions, and summarizing documents. For example, in the sentence “Apple Inc. is opening a store in New York,” NER would identify “Apple Inc.” as an organization and “New York” as a location.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the spaCy library for NER. With spaCy, you load a language model, process your text, and it automatically finds and labels named entities. You can then print out each entity and its label, such as ‘PERSON’ or ‘ORG’, to see what has been extracted and categorized. This makes it easy to pull structured information from large amounts of text.\n",

    "Extractive Summarisation: This approach selects and combines the most important sentences or phrases directly from the original text, typically using algorithms that score sentence importance.

    "- Document summarisation: Creating abstracts or executive summaries for research papers, business reports, or legal documents.\n",
